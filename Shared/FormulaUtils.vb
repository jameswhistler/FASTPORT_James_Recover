    ''' <summary>
    ''' The FormulaUtils class contains a set of functions that are available
    ''' in the Formula editor.  You can specify any of these functions after
    ''' the = sign.
    ''' For example, you can say:
    '''     = IsEven(32)
    ''' These functions throw an exception on an error.  The formula evaluator
    ''' catches this exception and returns the error string to the user interface.
    '''
    ''' All of the functions operate as a Decimal.  The Decimal data type is better
    ''' then Double or Single since it provides a more accurate value as compared to
    ''' Double, and a larger value as compared to a Single.  All integers, doubles, etc.
    ''' are converted to Decimals as part of these functions.
    '''
    ''' Function names are not case sensitive. So you can use ROUND, Round, round, etc.
